NOTE:
> I'm not sure if everyone can open the .swf by just double clicking it but you should be able to drag it over the flash player included in the folder to run it. Otherwise just install JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler from GitHub.

> (AS OF b1.0) Do not activate NoClip while moving as it will hold your last input due to NoClip controls overriding the normal controls. It's a lazy method but it works. 

> (AS OF b1.0) Make sure to disable gravity using "Numpad1" before activating NoClip or you will fall through the world. Hitting "R" to return to your last save point seems to fix this.

> (AS OF b1.1) The Truffle Respawn just wipes the truffle data and then reloads using the same code as if you hit "R" in order to reload the level and spawn the truffles back. In a future update I will fix this so it deletes old truffles and spawns new ones without sending you back to a save point.
